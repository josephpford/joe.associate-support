# Accessibility 

Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that would prevent anyone from using or interacting with your website or application. When you think of web accessibility you may immediately think of screen readers or motor assistance but accessibility includes everyone. Think of people in areas with slow internet access, those who do not have access to computers and need to use mobile devices. At some point all of us will become old, or have injuries which will hinder our mobility and the way we use a computer and interact on the web. Web accessibility is difficult for a lot of people to understand because it’s very hard to solve a problem that we ourselves have never experienced. This is why it’s so important to take the time to educate yourself on what you can do to make your products (website and applications) more inclusive.

Accessibility should never be an afterthought, it starts with good design. Good usability is good accessibility. The UN has now declared internet access to be a [fundamental human right](https://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7) and this makes complete sense in our day and age. Today we use the internet for everything from education, to job searches and applications, connecting with friends and family, to accessing life saving information in the case of emergencies etc. This is why it’s so important for everyone, no matter their abilities, location or circumstances to be able to use and access everything on the internet.

## HTML
- [ ] Use semantic HTML - Semantic elements provide defaults or shortcuts to a more usable and accessible web. They provide consistent and well-tested components for common interactions. Assistive technology (like a screen reader) uses semantic HTML to interpret each element to its user, this is another way of saying that semantic HTML gives context to screen readers. 
- [ ] Keep divs and spans as presentational markup only.
- [ ] Keep your styles and your markup separate.
- [ ] Headings are important! Screen reader users can navigate a page according to its headings, listen to a list of all headings, and skip to a desired heading to begin reading at that point.
- [ ] Use real text over graphics
- [ ] all images should have alt text - describe the image in words 
- [ ] Test your work!

## CSS 

- [ ] scalable units for fonts - this give the user control to bump up or down the font size on the entire site. 
- [ ] Keep color contrast in mind
    - [ ] Some people find a harsh black on white can be tiring to read, so it's often worth considering softening the contrast just a little
    - [ ]On the other hand don’t make your text too light
    - [ ] You can use tools like [https://contrastchecker.com/](https://contrastchecker.com/) to check your contrast
- [ ] It’s important to compress your images so that they will load for those without a high speed internet connection. It is possible to resize images without compromising their quality. If you are working with photoshop you have an option to “save for web”. You can also use an image optimizer like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). As a general rule of thumb, product photos should be a maximum 80-150 KB, and for large homepage hero images a maximum of 250-350 KB. Those are good benchmark numbers for you to aim for.
