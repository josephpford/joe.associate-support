# Git After-Hours Lesson

## Assumptions

This lesson assumes that you already have Git installed/configured and have very basic understanding of repositories, branches and commits.

<i>If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.</i>

## Goals

This lesson will walk you through various development scenarios
  - Visualizing Commit History
  - Merge Conflicts
  - Squashing Commits
  - Undoing / Reverting Changes
  - Cherry Picking 

## GitHub-Flow branch-based workflow

Before we get to development scenarios, let's take a moment to understand the concept of a branching model. There are [multiple branching models](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) in use today for Git. [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) is a branching model that can use different branches to track multiple releases simultaneously, and [GitHub-Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) is a newer branching model that emphasizes simplicity for frequent deployments. There is no "best" branching model, just different branching models with different pros and cons.

We are going to use the GitHub-Flow branching model in this lesson.

## Visualizing Commit History

Git is hard. There are tools to make it easier.

Install [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
  - Sourcetree is a Git GUI client. 
  - It will help us visualize commits, branching, merging

Install [P4Merge](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/visual-merge-tool)
  - Helix Visual Merge Tool (P4Merge) is a three-way merging and side-by-side file comparison tool.
  - It will help us visualize merge conflicts
